### NextJs 15 TypeScript Starter with ShadCN, TailwindCSS and Prettier Plugin For TailwindCSS

Why did I choose these?

- ShadCN: An amazing component library [https://ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com).
- Prettier Plugin for TailwindCSS sorts Tailwind classes according to an order agreed upon at Tailwind Labs: [https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)
- TypeScript, because I'm learning TypeScript as more and more projects that I love now use TypeScript as opposed to JavaScript.
- The default font is set to Geist Sans in `globals.css` - the current default font in NextJs 15.
